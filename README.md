A basic weather app using OpenWeather.org's api. Axios is used to get the data. I used 
Material UI for the content, and CSS3 for the header and footer. Future plans are to include
dynamic backgrounds, city input and more data including forecasts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
